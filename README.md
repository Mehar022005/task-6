# task-6
This project implements the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm using the classic **Iris dataset**.

# Objective
To understand and apply KNN for multi-class classification and visualize performance.

# Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

# Steps Performed
1. Loaded the Iris dataset.
2. Normalized the features using StandardScaler.
3. Split data into training and testing sets.
4. Trained a KNN model (k=3).
5. Evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix.
6. Visualized the confusion matrix.

# Accuracy Achieved
> Accuracy: ~100%
